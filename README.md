This simulator was created as part of work done at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/).

## Modifications in panos branch compared to master branch

Significant modifications in main scripts of simulator.

Created a new map in simulation full of intersections
- `Duckietown-panos_map`

Automate data extraction in intersections:
- Press `A` : automatically executes left turn in intersections and collects images and velocities in numpy arrays
- Press `D` : automatically executes right turn in intersections and collects images and velocities in numpy arrays
- Press `H` : delete images and velocities from last left turn 
- Press `J` : delete images and velocities from last right turn 
- Press `U` : close simulation and save all images and velocities in .npy files

Run TensorFlow graphs in simulator:
- Press `4 (numpad)` : run TensorFlow CNN graph for left turns in intersections
- Press `6 (numpad)` : run TensorFlow CNN graph for right turns in intersections
- Press `8 (numpad)` : run TensorFlow CNN graph for lane following

General actions for all the above TensorFlow graphs in simulator:
- Press `ESC` : close simulation without saving the images and velocities
- Press `SPACE` : interrupt all the above actions and returns duckiebot to rest (v=0, omega=0)
- Press `BACKSPACE` : reset simulation and place duckiebot in random position in the map (all the collected data up to that point are not deleted and continue appending new data to them)
